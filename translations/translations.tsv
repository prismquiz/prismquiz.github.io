elections	4	Voting is really an unnecessary process, the whims of the masses are irrelevant

concentration	2	We should distribute power by region in the nation, with representatives from each region deciding national policy, but also leaving many issues to the regions themselves to decide locally
concentration	3	Power should be concentrated according to wealth. Citizens who are wealthier have a bigger stake in the nation and in most cases understand both a specialization, how people think, and what they want, which allowed them to become wealthy
concentration	4	Nobody should have the power to make laws, people should have the freedom to decide for themselves what is wrong and what is justified
concentration	5	Only those who have served in the military and potentially risked their life for the nation can be fully trusted with the nation's interests, and only those who served it should thus be given a voice in power
concentration	6	We need a single leader above all who can serve for life and be able to fully understand the big picture. Without worrying about what the public thinks, the leader can make the best decisions for the nation as a whole

districts	1	The government should represent the people who represented it through the military and other national service
districts	2	We should have districts nationally with representatives that represent roughly the same number of people, but a guaranteed minimum representation for geographic areas

districts	4	There should be a single non-elected ruler who represents everyone by considering the interests of the entire nation when making decisions
districts	5	Each person should look out for their own interests, not through government or voting, but through their own means
districts	6	The population does not need to be represented so much as all parties who the policy will effect need a specialized representative to analyze the issue from that perspective

secession		Right to Secession
secession	0	We should not have provinces and be a unitary state, so there should not be anywhere clearly defined to be able to secede
secession	1	Provinces should not be allowed to secede, however, we should give states more flexibility in setting their own laws such that they can pass the laws that they want except in extreme cases such as violating human rights
secession	2	Those who want independence should not be forced to remain a part of our nation, any individual should have the right to take their own land and property and declare themselves independent without a vote
secession	3	Provinces should have the right to secede. It should be possible for one to organize a referendum and secede if it passes with overwhelming support
secession	4	Provinces should exist but in most cases should not be given independence referendums, and certainly not as a right

leaderselect	3	Leaders should be chosen through military experience. Those who have proved their ability to lead by working their way up the ranks deserve to lead the nation

policysetting		Power for Policy-Setting

policysetting	1	The executive of the nation should hold the majority of decision-making power and generally be the one to create policy
policysetting	2	An elected national legislative branch should primarily be the one to set policy for the entire nation and overrule any laws at the provincial level
policysetting	3	Policy-setting power should lie within the executive branch, but through the appointed cabinet and bureaucracy who can better specialize their knowledge more than the executive
policysetting	4	Power should lie with the people directly, who should initiate legislation through citizen-initiated ballot measures
policysetting	5	The wealthiest individuals should hold power, as they are generally the most capable and contribute the most to the nation

policysetting	7	No person or body should hold power over an individual, we should be free to live our lives
policysetting	8	Power should be shared between the national and local governments roughly equally

peoplepolicy	1	The wealthy tend to know what they want and have good opinions, but the poor rarely know what is good for them
peoplepolicy	2	The general population has bad opinions and the government would be better off without their opinions
peoplepolicy	3	People must be given a say, but government must try to avoid the tyranny of the majority by having more local representation rather than enforcing the nationwide popular opinion on the whole nation
peoplepolicy	4	Other people's opinions should not have an effect on what you are allowed to do
peoplepolicy	5	The population generally knows what they want, but cannot be expected to have the time to research and vote on each issue and should delegate it it to representatives
healthcare		Healthcare
healthcare	0	I support private insurance and healthcare providers, but ensuring that prices are competitive relative to the cost to produce them and prosecuting any cases of price fixing
healthcare	1	I do not want to ban private healthcare or insurance, but I want a public option that will provide a fair rate, that will put private companies that are taking advantage of customers out of business
healthcare	2	Both Healthcare and treatment should be directly provided and guaranteed to all citizens by the nation
healthcare	3	I believe in having not just one, but many government-owned healthcare options. The cost for all of them will be paid for, but you can choose the one that you think has the best service, to create competition between them
healthcare	4	Healthcare should be left to the free market. If healthcare providers or insurers aren't providing affordable service, they will not have customers and go out of business
healthcare	5	Healthcare service should be private, but I will ensure that the government provides a single-payer system to ensure nobody needs to worry about being able to afford the healthcare they need
healthcare	6	Allowing healthcare providers to set their own prices freely allows them to fund additional research and benefits us all by providing new, better treatments
minwage		Minimum Wage
minwage	0	All companies should be required to split their profits fairly throughout their employees. Anyone in charge of the company should not be allowed to be paid significantly more than those at the bottom of the company
minwage	1	There should be a national program that guarantees a job with a wage that people can live comfortably on, working on things such as better infrastructure. Companies that pay less than that will have trouble finding workers to fill their openings
minwage	2	The majority of working people should be paid the value of their labor (with a minimum, a comfortable living wage). There should also be a maximum wage, and managers and executives should be paid a lot less.
minwage	3	People should be guaranteed a living wage from their jobs. They should be able to work a single job with reasonable hours and be guaranteed enough to afford everything they need
minwage	4	There should be no minimum wage. The markets will figure out how much labor is worth and allow us to keep prices competitive with those produced with labor abroad
minwage	5	There should be a moderate living wage that won't put small businesses out of business, as well as a tax on large companies with many workers below the poverty line to pay for any welfare their employees receive and ensure small businesses are competitive
minwage	6	Workers should have a minimum wage to prevent a race to the bottom, but executives develop ideas for their business and take risks in founding it and thus deserve a large portion of their company's profits
minwage	7	People should produce as they can and consume what they need. The concept of money should not exist
isp		Internet Service Providers
isp	0	We should regulate internet service providers to ensure that they provide nationwide coverage and that there are multiple options everywhere to allow competition, and prosecute them if the companies form deals that allow them to create regional monopolies
isp	1	It is expensive for ISPs to connect areas to the internet. They will do their best to ensure coverage at an affordable price, and should only be penalized if they fail to deliver the quality and reliability of internet that they advertised
isp	2	Through taxes, the government should subsidize multiple internet service providers expanding to all areas of the nation in exchange for price guarantees to ensure that everyone has multiple affordable options for internet
isp	3	We should have a national internet service provider that guarantees affordable, reliable, high-speed internet through the entire country. Private companies will have to compete with that as a baseline
isp	4	High Speed Internet Service Providers must be nationalized. They aren't able to have fair competition due to the cost of laying out cables, especially in rural areas
isp	5	We must make it feasible for people to start government-backed internet service providers in their area. These will be owned by the government and provided to everyone, however, people may choose which ISP they want among the options in the area
isp	6	Internet service providers should not be regulated and will find the fair price for internet, which may vary based on how expensive it is to connect an area, based on how much that is worth
ubi		Universal Basic Income
ubi	0	Guaranteeing income is a dangerous idea that disincentivizes working. This would hurt the economy, and I cannot support it
ubi	1	I support a universal basic income paid for by large companies outsourcing or automating jobs almost as much as the difference in cost to allow small businesses to remain competitive
ubi	2	The poor should be guaranteed essentials through government-run public options with discounted rates for the elderly and those in poverty rather than a universal basic income
ubi	3	I support a universal wage a bit lower than the average wage more than a basic income. Those who cannot work due to medical conditions, temporary unemployment, or in retirement should receive it, and the employed should be guaranteed at least that much.
ubi	4	I am opposed to a universal basic income. Working people should be guaranteed a living wage, and benefits for the unemployed and unable to work should be more than a UBI would be worth. The rich do not need that extra bit of income
ubi	5	I support a universal basic income consisting of the profits from government-run companies to distribute their successes and ensure minimal risk for the less successful government-run companies
ubi	6	I support a universal basic income. The poor should not have to prove their status of being poor and have the government manage how they spend their welfare for them
ubi	7	Rather than starting taxation at 0%, there should be a threshold, and those below the threshold are paid, and those who make more than the threshold are taxed, and you should always receive more by working to ensure there is always an incentive to work.
ubi	8	People should be guaranteed their needs. As such, income such as Universal Basic Income should not exist
utilities		Utilities
utilities	0	Utilities will find a fair competitive price. They should not be regulated, even if only one company services an area, they have to compete because people will take them into account when choosing an area to live in
utilities	1	Utilities should be owned by local governments or communities. They will be responsive to the small group they serve, and can be replaced by the community if they are not meeting the needs of the community
utilities	2	Utilities such as electricity and water should be nationalized. They are public goods that everyone needs. Public control allows the best quality since in many places, there is only one option
utilities	3	The government should subsidize utility companies expanding to all areas of the nation. In exchange for this assistance, companies must guarantee a fair price and other guarantees such as a certain percentage of renewable electricity each year
utilities	4	It is expensive for companies to set up utility infrastructure, and they should be expected to set a fair profitable price to make up their investments in a reasonable time
utilities	5	We should have national utilities companies, but not ban private companies. If they can find a market, they can compete with the nationalized options
utilities	6	Utilities should be regulated to ensure that systems are compatible so that multiple companies can connect to the same building. We must prosecute monopolies that do not give a choice
privateschools		Private Schools
privateschools	0	Schools should be private, but the government should provide vouchers to the poor to ensure that every child is able to afford attending school
privateschools	1	All schools should be public schools, however, parents and students should be able to choose which public school they attend rather than having it chosen automatically based on location
privateschools	2	The state should own all schools. This makes it easier to ensure all our students have an equal opportunity to succeed
privateschools	3	There should be a mixture of public and private schools, however, public schools should receive a lot of funding to ensure our children are well educated and ensure they are competitive with private schools
privateschools	4	There should not be public schools. The state should have no obligation to provide education to those who cannot afford it
outsourcing		Outsourcing
outsourcing	0	The Government should nationalize all manufacturing in the nation, and should not outsource jobs
outsourcing	1	We should have national manufacturing subsidized by taxes to keep prices competitive with outsourced jobs. Buyers can decide for themselves which are better
outsourcing	2	We should remove the minimum wage here. Then costs of producing here will be lower than producing abroad and shipping here
outsourcing	3	We should regulate companies to only provide subsidies and government purchases to businesses that perform key manufacturing within the nation, not abroad
outsourcing	4	Outsourcing manual labor allows our citizens to have cheap goods and not have to do routine manual labor, allowing jobs here to be complex work
outsourcing	5	The government should own most industry, but should allow competition between them so there is not just one choice. Since they are government-owned, we can ensure it is all domestically produced
outsourcing	6	We should impose heavy fees on goods produced in countries with worse labor rights than us to ensure companies can produce everything here and have fair competition
bankcrash		Bank Crashing that Will Damage the Economy
bankcrash	0	We should create a single national government-owned bank, and buy all the current banks including the one that is failing. This ensures everyone can pay the same rates and that we can take on the debt the failing one owes
bankcrash	1	The issue is that we have private megabanks. We should instead have local-government-owned community banks that work in the interests of the communities they represent and fund businesses in the area
bankcrash	2	We must not interfere with the free markets. It will fail, and eventually the economy will rebuild itself
bankcrash	3	We should break up big banks before they get to a situation where a crash like this can be caused by one company
bankcrash	4	We should bail out the bank to save the economy but eventually have the bank pay back the money with interest
bankcrash	5	We should purchase this bank and run it as a national bank. Other banks can compete with us, but we can guarantee we won't go bankrupt
bankcrash	6	Banks should not exist in any form
highways		Highways
highways	0	Local governments should build and maintain highways. This ensures they are responsive to the wishes of local communities and their wishes
highways	1	Roads should be privatized. Private highways ensure that only those who use them pay for them and will create better quality
highways	2	We should have many highways be public, but allow private highways to be built to compete. If their quality or placement allows them to be profitable because people choose them, that's a positive for everyone
highways	3	Highways should be operated by the national government. This ensures we can guarantee road quality nationwide that is free for everyone, and should employ a lot of people to work on ensuring top quality
debt		National Debt
debt	0	We should take on debt both to improve the economy and to invest in our population in ways that will pay back more in the long run. We should pay for this debt through higher taxes on bigger companies
debt	1	The government controls the currency. We can print more money when we need more money, and legislate prices to stay level to keep inflation from becoming a problem
debt	2	We should be mindful of debt and pay it off when possible. When the economy takes a downturn, we should spend to help it survive, but we should cut government spending and pay back debt when it picks back up
debt	3	Having national debt is not a bad thing, and we should not cut spending programs to pay it off, though we should have a plan before adding to it
debt	4	The government should not have debt because it should not be spending. We should cut all spending programs and pay off the debt as quickly as possible
debt	5	Currency should not exist, and as a result, debt should not exist
consumergoods		Consumer Goods Production
consumergoods	0	Government-owned industry should manufacture all consumer goods for the population
consumergoods	1	Anyone should be able to start a government-backed company that can produce competing consumer goods
consumergoods	2	The government should not be producing consumer goods, that is for the markets to produce
consumergoods	3	The government should produce consumer goods to ensure an affordable price, however the free market should be able to compete with it
consumergoods	4	The government should regulate consumer goods to ensure safety and compliance with standards, but not produce them
consumergoods	5	The nation should guarantee consumer goods to meet everyone's needs, provided by those who are able to make them without any sort of currency
genetic		Genetic Engineering
genetic	0	Genetic engineering should not only be allowed, but required. We should modify infants to be perfect at exactly what we need and plan their lives so they can integrate perfectly with society without questioning their place
genetic	1	The government should not stand in the way of genetic engineering. Those who wish to create better children using technology should be allowed to
genetic	2	We should use genetic modification for good, such as eradicating diseases and correcting genetic defects, but should leave most traits to genetics
genetic	3	Human genetics should not be something we alter. Unless there is certain death for the person in question without genetic modification, we should avoid it
genetic	4	Genetic engineering poses a major threat of allowing the super-rich to have inhumanly perfect babies who can outperform the poor, furthering societal class gaps, which should be banned except in cases of life and death
flagburn		Flag-Burning
flagburn	0	The nation has major issues, and the only way to get them addressed is to draw attention. Flag burning is fairly harmless but gets attention, so it's a good protest method
flagburn	1	It should be mandatory to support the nation, and as such, damaging a flag should be very illegal.
flagburn	2	I support the right to protest and destroy flags, but flag-burning should be regulated for safety to ensure that it does not pose a danger to people or property, through the smoke or fire
flagburn	3	A flag is a symbol of our nation. To destroy a flag is a hostile act against the nation and should be illegal
flagburn	4	This should be a free country, and if you own a flag, you should be free to burn it if that's what you want to do
freespeech		Free Speech
freespeech	0	You should have the freedom to say anything. It's not illegal until you actually take an illegal action based on the speech
freespeech	1	Speech should be free, but you should not be guaranteed protection from backlash, including being removed from platforms if your opinions are unwelcome there
freespeech	2	You should not have freedom of speech. The state should decide what is acceptable to say
freespeech	3	Speech should generally be free, if it is literal speech. However, symbolic speech such as destroying a symbols of the government or religious texts are grossly offensive and should be banned
freespeech	4	We should ban and penalize very offensive language such as slurs. These should be penalized through fines offline and deplatforming online
drugs		Drugs
drugs	0	Drugs are dangerous for our society and can tear apart families and relationships. Selling them for recreational use should be banned for our safety and we should have programs to educate people on the dangers they pose
drugs	1	Bans on many drugs like marijuana were designed to disproportionately affect the poor and minorities. We should overturn most drug-related convictions and institute programs to help addicts get their lives back in order
drugs	2	What you put in your own body is your own business. We should legalize drugs so that they don't go to the black market
drugs	3	We should educate our children to the dangers of drugs and ban the most harmful ones, but ones like Marijuana should be legal for recreational use
drugs	4	We can use drugs to ensure people are incapable of causing trouble. We can mandate them and only provide them to when people act in accordance with how the state requires
baker		Religious Baker Refuses to Make Gay Marriage Cake
baker	0	Unless they were asking him to draw a graphic image depicting homosexuality, he should not have a problem with it. If it's just writing their names and something like a pride flag, it's discrimination to refuse the request
baker	1	This is unacceptable discrimination and homophobia. This man should not be in business
baker	2	The couple should be arrested. They should be pairing with someone who they can produce babies with
baker	3	The baker is being asked to make something against his religion. He should have no obligation to create something celebrating that
baker	4	People should never be mandated to do anything. He should be able to deny his services to anyone for any reason, they can get one elsewhere
abortion		Abortion
abortion	0	The right to life is a fundamental right, and abortion should be banned in nearly all cases
abortion	1	Bans on abortions primarily hurt the poor and often leaves single mothers stuck in poverty with a baby. Abortion should be legal for everyone
abortion	2	You should have full control over your body, including the right to have an abortion
abortion	3	Abortion should be legal but rare. People should be educated of alternate methods of contraception and there should be restrictions on late-term abortions without a reason
abortion	4	If the state approves you to have a baby, you should have it unless the mother's life is in danger. People who are not approved to have babies should have abortions mandated, however, and face strict penalties
climate		Climate Change
climate	0	We must act to prevent climate change, and everyone must do their part. We should provide incentives for individuals to go green, and regulate companies to meet environmental standards
climate	1	Corporations and the rich are the biggest contributors to climate change. We should direct most of our regulations at them to ensure that people are not wasting energy powering a giant mansion they don't need
climate	2	Global warming doesn't actually exist. Itâ€™s crazy to ask everyone to overhaul things like their buildings and cars to combat it.
climate	3	People should not be mandated to do anything to fight climate change. People may voluntarily reduce emissions it if they wish
climate	4	The population should be expected to minimize their own waste to ensure that as many resources as possible remain for the state to use to support their interests
reproductive		Reproductive Incentives
reproductive	0	We need to keep our population in check, but incentives will not stop the rich, so we should have a hard limit on the number of children a person may have
reproductive	1	People should have as many children as they want. That is not the business of the state
reproductive	2	We should encourage our native citizens to have more children by offering tax incentives to ensure they can support our economy as our population ages and ensure our culture is passed down
reproductive	3	The Earth has a limit to the population it can support, and while we should not have strict controls, we should incentivize people to limit the number of children they have
reproductive	4	Those with genes that the state wants should have children and have children often, and those with poor genes should not be allowed to have children at all
reproductive	5	Population-limiting incentives would only hurt the poor, as the rich will not care about the incentives. We should offer financial support to the poor to ensure our youth are able to have their needs met growing up, but not enough to be considered an incentive
ai		Artificial Intelligence
ai	0	Artificial intelligence risks displacing living working people from their lifestyles and livelihoods. We should be hesitant to replace jobs with AI
ai	1	People and companies should be allowed to use AI freely
ai	2	We should fully embrace AI. Soon it will, and should be able to make decisions far more objectively and effectively than humans can.
ai	3	Artificial Intelligence largely takes jobs from low-income workers and can hurt their livelihoods. It also can hide discrimination through training AI on biased data. We should limit its use
ai	4	We should embrace AI but must be sure to make sure there are adequate alternatives for workers it will displace and that any damage it can do is limited and it will protect privacy
prostitution		Prostitution
prostitution	0	People should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If they want to sell themselves for sex, that's their own choice
prostitution	1	Sex should be reserved for marriage, or at least a long-term relationship. Prostitution and other sex work is immoral
prostitution	2	Unapproved sex should not be permitted, as it may result in children with less than ideal characteristics
prostitution	3	We should have regulated prostitution and other sex work because the alternative is a black market for it which is much worse
prostitution	4	Prostitution takes advantage of the poor by making them sell themselves off to rich people just to be able to pay the bills. It should be illegal to buy
immigration		Immigration
immigration	0	Immigrants caught breaking laws should be deported, but those who illegally enter the country should be overlooked and allowed to stay, as they work lower wages and in worse conditions than our citizens, and allow us to reduce the cost of living for our citizens
immigration	1	We need to be able to screen immigrants coming into our country and ultimately decide who enters. Those who enter unlawfully must be found and deported
immigration	2	We can accept immigrants, but they should be expected to learn our language and culture, and do their best to integrate with our people and way of life
immigration	3	We should accept and encourage talented, educated immigrants to move here. We can provide them the best of our country, and they can better our country with their talents
immigration	4	I support opening our borders to anyone who wants to immigrate. Freedom of movement is an essential human right
immigration	5	We should close our borders and completely shut down immigration. Our nation is for our people alone
immigration	6	We must ensure that there is a need for the immigrants we let in. Those who take low-paying jobs anyone can do are taking jobs from our own citizens. However, I would support immigrants with skills where we have a shortage
immigration	7	We must make it easy and quick to legally immigrate into this country. Immigrants improve our nation, and we can provide many of them a much better quality of life
parliament		Regional Union+Parliament (like the EU)
parliament	0	This union contains many nations with many languages, identities, and cultures, and they are able to maintain those cultural identities. As such, I see no issue with our membership
parliament	1	I support this regional union. We should use this common parliament to push forward legislation that benefits the people of all of our nations
parliament	2	This union allows us to better protect our people through international product safety standards and can allow us easier international trade deals, bring up our quality of life
parliament	3	I oppose being a part of any such union. I have no interest in what the laws of other nations are, but I am very much opposed to  giving them a say in our laws
parliament	4	Our laws are for our own people to decide, not those abroad. I oppose being a part of this union
parliament	5	Being a part of this regional union gives us a much greater say in international affairs, significant economic benefits, and allow us more diplomatic options. As such, I support being a part of it
parliament	6	The freedom of our people is my first priority, and the regulations from this union could restrict the freedom in this country. I am opposed to being a part of it
intcurrency		International Currency
intcurrency	0	Our historical currency is a part of our national identity. We cannot give that up for a slight ease of transactions with foreigners
intcurrency	1	Sharing a currency with neighboring nations increases our currency's stability and gives it more weight internationally, so I support it
intcurrency	2	I support sharing a currency with our neighbors, as it will simplify life for everyone in the shared currency zone and make international commerce easier
intcurrency	3	I am opposed to sharing a currency with other nations. We need to be able to make decisions about our currency internally, and foreigners should not have a say in that
intcurrency	4	I support using a shared currency with neighboring nations. It allows our people and theirs to easily travel to each other and eases transactions across the shared currency zone
intcurrency	5	Having the ability to print our own currency when we need to stimulate our economy is valuable to our nation, and is worth more than the benefits of a shared currency
intcurrency	6	The government should not be regulating currency, people should be free to choose what they accept as pay, such as cryptocurrency, material goods, or the currency of another nation, if they believe that has value
refugees		Refugees
refugees	0	We should accept refugees only if they are able to offer something to our nation, whether it is specialist talents, or intel on the country they are fleeing
refugees	1	It is our duty to help people in need. We should take in as many refugees as we are able to comfortably support
refugees	2	If they can make it to our country, we should not deny them entry, they should have the right to be a part of our nation
refugees	3	These people could pose a threat to our citizens. We should accept very few refugees only after extensive background checks, under strict conditions
refugees	4	Refugees are not our problem. They should not be allowed to enter the nation
refugees	5	We must have a system where refugees have background checks, but after they pass, we should let them in subject to conditions for integrating into our society
minoritylang		Minority Group Making Language Official Where Spoken a lot
minoritylang	0	People who do not speak our language should be deported. There is no reason for another language
minoritylang	1	We should add it as an additional language in that locality, as it can make life significantly easier for these people
minoritylang	2	It is important for our nation to have a single national official language. These people should be expected to learn and understand the national language
minoritylang	3	This will cause undue burden to our industries in labeling everything for all languages for all localities. We should have one national language
military		When Military Action should be used
military	0	We should use our military as a deterrent to ensure we are not attacked, as every time we enter a war, we are putting our citizens lives on the line
military	1	The state of other nations should not concern us, so any military we maintain should be for self-defense only
military	2	We should use our military to ensure the wellbeing and freedom of people around the world, such as contributing to international peacekeeping missions and efforts to replace governments that fail to respect human rights
military	3	We should use our military to assault and annex territory that should belong to us
military	4	Our military should defend our interests abroad to ensure we remain an influential presence, such as by overthrowing hostile governments
military	5	We should not have a military
military	6	We should primarily use our military to ensure our nation maintains its status and independence, such as by defending allies and ensuring other nations do not try to take our land or water
borderchecks		Agreement between Allies to Prevent Border Checks Between Them (Schengen)
borderchecks	0	I oppose this, as we should not be having people from other nations in our nation at all
borderchecks	1	It is important that we can examine who is coming into our nation, we cannot control who enters those nations, which is unacceptable
borderchecks	2	This agreement is a win for everyone and can make it possible for closer alliances between our people
borderchecks	3	I support this agreement. As long as these people respect our laws and values, this can make it easier for tourists to visit our nation and improve our national wealth
borderchecks	4	I support this, not just with our allies, but with all nations. People should be free to enter any nation
borderchecks	5	With this agreement, our people can easily vacation to our allies if they choose, with negligible additional risk, so I support this
borderchecks	6	We should not allow people to leave the nation, and as such, I am opposed to this
foreignaid		Foreign Aid
foreignaid	0	We should expand our influence abroad and foreign aid is a good way to gain favors and popular opinion abroad
foreignaid	1	Foreign aid can greatly improve the quality of lives of developing nations for relatively little cost to us, so we should provide it
foreignaid	2	We should put foreign aid into nations with poor standards. Improving the life there reduces worldwide refugees and protects our nation from them
foreignaid	3	We should not be spending our taxpayers' hard-earned money on other nations
foreignaid	4	The affairs of other nations do not matter to us, there is no reason to send foreign aid
foreignaid	5	Any government should be minimal, if it exists at all, and thus not have the funds to be paying money abroad
unres		United Nations Resolutions (Main 6 Bodies)
unres	0	We should not be a part of the UN
unres	1	I support having the United Nations or a similar new organization to replace governments such as our own to unify the world into a single country
unres	2	Our country should look out for our own people, not the people of the world, so we should not follow UN guidelines unless they happen to coincide with our own interests
unres	3	We should follow UN resolutions and put international pressure on nations that don't to make the world a better place for everyone
unres	4	Our nation's laws should not be decided by other nations, we can consider UN resolutions but should only pass them as laws in our nation if they match our interests
unres	5	We should attempt to use the united nations to our advantage, and support proposals that benefit us and encourage others to follow them, however we should only follow the proposals that benefit us
unres	6	We should not change our way of life because other nations say to.
espionage		Most Important Espionage Agency Tasks
espionage	0	We should use our foreign espionage agency to attempt to infiltrate our enemies abroad and overthrow leaders who oppose us when possible
espionage	1	The most important task is uncovering and tracking down the worst sorts of criminals who reside in our nation
espionage	2	We should use our espionage agencies primarily to identify terrorist threats that could pose a risk to our citizens
espionage	3	The most important espionage task is for our domestic agency to track down people who entered the nation illegally so we can deport them
espionage	4	The most important task is for our foreign espionage agency to uncover atrocities around the world and expose them
espionage	5	We should not even have a foreign espionage agency. Our domestic agency should focused on uncovering and tracking down criminals and people who entered the nation illegally
